# Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door

Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door provides centralized protection for your web applications. A web application firewall (WAF) defends your web services against common exploits and vulnerabilities. It keeps your service highly available for your users and helps you meet compliance requirements.

Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door is a global and centralized solution. It's deployed on Azure network edge locations around the globe. WAF-enabled web applications inspect every incoming request delivered by Azure Front Door at the network edge.

A WAF prevents malicious attacks close to the attack sources before they enter your virtual network. You get global protection at scale without sacrificing performance. A WAF policy easily links to any Azure Front Door profile in your subscription. New rules can be deployed within minutes, so you can respond quickly to changing threat patterns.
